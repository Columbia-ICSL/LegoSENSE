# LegoSENSE
LegoSENSE makes building and deploying sensing systems as easy and as fast as building legos, for **everyone**. LegoSENSE is a software & hardware framework for rapid sensor deployments.

We have provided detailed documentation (and instructional videos soon), for both users, and developers looking to expand the ecosystem.

## Getting Started

For general users, if your system did not come with the software, please flash our prebuilt Raspberry Pi image to the SD card and plug in the hardware.

To develop or build the system from source, please clone this repository using the following git commands. Make sure to pass the `--recurse-submodules` flag to the clone command.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Columbia-ICSL/LegoSENSE.git
```

`/software` contains the source code for LegoSENSE's software system running on Raspberry Pi.

`/hardware` contains all the design resources for developing hardware modules for LegoSENSE, including instructions, hardware references, and design templates.
